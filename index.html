    <h1>Github Testing</h1>
    <p>I created this page to learn how to collaborate on github with others' projects by forking a repository, committing changes, and pulling a request by using the denzellsilva account.</p>
    <p>I also have annother account (accnakosalaptop) on github which can receive the pull request. That account will be used to learn how to add a collaborator on a repository, and merge pull requests on the original source code.</p>
